# 🚀 SPARK – Launching Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project correctly on your machine.

---

## 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/NoraFisal/2025_GP_34.git

## 2. Navigate to the Project Folder
cd 2025_GP_34

## 3. Install Flutter Dependencies
flutter pub get

---

## 4. Download Required ML Model Files (IMPORTANT)

GitHub does NOT include the machine-learning model files because they exceed GitHub’s size limit.

You must download them manually from Google Drive:

Model Files:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v3Zo-baUsxC8qw4N_H9L36EYDMnDUK2G

After downloading, place the files inside:

assets/model/

Required files:
- random_forest_v5.json
- feature_means_v5.json
- feature_cols_v5.txt

Then run:
flutter pub get

---

## 5. Riot API Key (REQUIRED)

To run SPARK, you MUST generate your own Riot API Key.

### Step 1 — Create a Riot Developer Account
Go to:
https://developer.riotgames.com/

Click:
“Sign In” → “Create Account”

Complete the registration.

### Step 2 — Generate Your API Key
After logging in, go to your dashboard:
https://developer.riotgames.com/apis

You will find your API Key under:
**"Development API Key"**

Click:
**"Generate New Key"**

Important Notes:
- Riot API keys expire every **24 hours**.
- You must regenerate a new key daily if you're testing the application.
- Without a valid key, the application will NOT fetch Riot data.

### Step 3 — Add Your Key to the Project
Open the file:

lib/data/riot_link_service.dart

Update this line:
static const String apiKey = "PUT_YOUR_RIOT_API_KEY_HERE";

Example:
static const String apiKey = "RGAPI-12345678-abcd-90ef-1234-abcdef987654";

(Replace only the key, keep the quotation marks.)
